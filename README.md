# Tiny Birds' Treasures

Tiny Birds' Treasures is a local multiplayer hidden object game, made competitve!
Two tiny birds duel is out in a short match to find and collect only the best items us silly humans have lost!

# How Was this made?

This game was made over two days for GGJ 2021!
This game was made in Unity - all C# files are located in the main assets folder. 

The github version of this project can be found at: [https://github.com/alessia-ip/Caw](https://github.com/alessia-ip/Caw)
(It was called Caw before I had a proper name for the game!)
The github version has the gitignore, so there are no potenitally extra funky files!

The most important bit of code is keeping track of all interactable objects and shuffling their positions and which ones are worth points, so every game is different!
This seed is based on clock time, so it is fairly randomized each round.
